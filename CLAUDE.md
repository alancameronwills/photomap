# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm start          # kills any existing server on port 3000, then: node --env-file=.env server.js
npm run dev        # nodemon --env-file=.env server.js (auto-reload; does not kill existing)
npm run test:unit  # node:test unit tests (test/*.test.js) — no server/AWS needed
npm run test:e2e   # start-server-and-test: boots the server, runs the Cypress suite headless
```

The server runs on port 3000 by default (`PORT` env var overrides this). `kill-server.js` is the prestart hook — it uses PowerShell's `Get-NetTCPConnection` to find and kill the process on port 3000.

Tests: `test/*.test.js` are fast unit tests (the `dynamo-helpers` pagination/batch logic against a fake client, and the `public/tile-math.js` slippy-map/URL-normalisation helpers). `cypress/e2e/*.cy.js` are end-to-end tests that hit the live local server (SQLite mode) — `api.cy.js` exercises the HTTP API, `robustness.cy.js` covers error-handling/validation, and the rest cover UI flows.

AWS deployment: `npm run deploy` (requires Docker + SAM CLI), which runs `sam build --use-container && sam deploy`. `samconfig.toml` (gitignored) holds the saved deploy parameters. The service worker is **network-first**, so a deploy's fresh assets are picked up online without any cache-busting. **Only bump the SW cache version when you change `sw.js` routing or the cache-key formats in `tile-math.js`** — run `npm run bump-cache` before deploying (rewrites `CACHE_VERSION` in `public/tile-math.js` to a fresh UTC timestamp, dropping old caches on SW activate). Don't bump routinely: it discards the prefetched offline tile/photo cache, forcing Track mode to re-download on the next walk.

## Deployment modes

The codebase supports two deployment modes selected automatically by environment variables:

| Mode | Trigger | DB | Photo storage | Sessions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Local** | No `POIS_TABLE` set | SQLite (`db-sqlite.js`) | Local disk (`uploads/`) | In-memory |
| **AWS** | `POIS_TABLE` set (by SAM) | DynamoDB (`db-dynamo.js`) | S3 (`PHOTOS_BUCKET`) | DynamoDB (`SESSIONS_TABLE`) |

**`db.js`** is a one-line router that loads `db-dynamo.js` or `db-sqlite.js` based on `POIS_TABLE`.

## Environment

All configuration lives in `.env` (gitignored). Key variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MAPTILER_KEY` | NLS Historic OS tile layer (MapTiler tileset `uk-osgb1888`) | *(layer disabled)* |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Edit-mode login password | `changeme` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Express session signing key | `photomap-dev-secret` |
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `3000` |

AWS-only (set via `template.yaml` / SAM, not `.env`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POIS_TABLE` / `PHOTOS_TABLE` / `ROUTES_TABLE` / `NODES_TABLE` / `SESSIONS_TABLE` | DynamoDB table names |
| `PHOTOS_BUCKET` | S3 bucket for photo storage |

`MAPTILER_KEY` is exposed to the browser via `GET /config.js` → `window.APP_CONFIG.maptilerKey`. No other env vars reach the client.

## Architecture

### Backend (Node.js / Express)

**`server.js`** — entry point. Mounts routes, serves `public/` as static files, injects env config at `/config.js`, and exposes npm package dist files at `/vendor/leaflet`, `/vendor/markercluster`, `/vendor/exifr`. In AWS mode: redirects `/uploads/*` to S3 presigned URLs and uses a DynamoDB session store (whose `get()` treats an unparseable `sess` row as no session rather than erroring). In local mode: serves `uploads/` as static files and uses the default in-memory session store. Exports `{ app }` for `lambda.js`; calls `app.listen` only when not running in Lambda. The JSON body limit is 5mb (so large GPX imports aren't rejected). A terminal error-handling middleware (mounted after the routes) converts async-handler rejections and multer/body-parser errors into JSON responses with a sensible status — so the API never returns Express's default HTML error page, which the client's `res.json()` couldn't parse.

**`lambda.js`** — AWS Lambda entry point. Wraps `app` from `server.js` using `@vendia/serverless-express`.

**`db.js`** — thin router: loads `db-dynamo.js` or `db-sqlite.js` based on `POIS_TABLE`.

**`db-sqlite.js`** — SQLite implementation via `better-sqlite3`. Opens synchronously at startup, creates tables on first run. All queries are synchronous prepared statements.

**`db-dynamo.js`** — DynamoDB implementation. All functions are async and return Promises. IDs are UUIDs (vs auto-increment integers in SQLite). Route node `poi_id` is omitted from items (not stored as NULL) when unset, since DynamoDB GSI keys cannot be NULL. Full-table reads go through `scanAll` (paginates `LastEvaluatedKey` — a bare Scan caps at 1 MB and would silently truncate) and batch deletes through `batchWrite` (retries `UnprocessedItems`), both from **`dynamo-helpers.js`**.

**`dynamo-helpers.js`** — small, client-agnostic DynamoDB helpers (`scanAll`, `batchWrite`) kept separate from `db-dynamo.js` so they can be unit-tested with a fake client (see `test/dynamo-helpers.test.js`); no AWS credentials or network needed.

> **TODO (robustness): DynamoDB multi-step writes aren't atomic.** `splitRoute`, `deletePoiLinkedNodes`/`deletePoi`, `deleteRouteNode`, and bulk `/upload-photos` issue several sequential writes with no rollback, so a mid-sequence failure can leave half-migrated nodes, a route with <2 nodes, or S3 objects with no DB row. SQLite runs these inside a transaction; DynamoDB does not. Fix by folding the ≤100-item cascades into `TransactWriteCommand`s where the item count allows.

Both db modules export the same function signatures:
- `haversineMeters` / `findNearestPoi` — used by the bulk-upload route to geo-group photos
- `addPhoto` / `deletePhoto` / `updatePhoto(id, {caption, direction, markerX, markerY, markerRotation})` — photo CRUD; `updatePhoto` persists per-photo annotations
- `deletePoiLinkedNodes(poiId)` — removes all route nodes linked to a POI, cascades routes that fall below 2 nodes; called before `deletePoi`
- `deleteRouteNode(id)` — returns `{deletedNodeIds, routeDeleted, routeId}`; cascades the route when ≤1 node remains
- `insertRouteNode(routeId, afterNodeId, lat, lng, poiId)` — inserts between two nodes using floating-point bisection of `order_index`
- `splitRoute(routeId, splitNodeId)` — deletes the split node, moves tail nodes (≥2) to a new route, cleans up degenerate remainders; returns `{headDeleted, deletedHeadNodeIds, deletedTailNodeIds, newRoute}`

**`routes/auth.js`** — stateless single-user auth. Login compares plaintext against `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, calls `req.session.save()` explicitly before responding (required on Lambda where the process may freeze before the async session write completes).

**`routes/api.js`** — all POI, photo, and route endpoints. Storage behaviour is selected at startup by `IS_AWS = !!process.env.PHOTOS_BUCKET`:
- **Local**: `multer.memoryStorage()` → `sharp` in memory → write to `uploads/originals/` and `uploads/thumbs/` via `fs`. Photo URLs are plain `/uploads/...` paths.
- **AWS**: `multer.memoryStorage()` → `sharp` in memory → `PutObjectCommand` to S3. All POI responses include presigned `url` and `thumb_url` fields (1-hour expiry) so the browser loads photos directly from S3 without routing through Lambda.

Coordinates on the POI and route-node create/update endpoints are coerced through a `finite()` helper — non-numeric `lat`/`lng` gets a 400 rather than letting `NaN` reach the DB (SQLite stores it as NULL; DynamoDB rejects it). `DELETE /api/pois/:id` removes the DB rows (route nodes, then the POI/photo rows) **before** unlinking the photo files, so a failed file cleanup can't leave a row pointing at a missing file.

`POST /api/upload-photos` is the bulk import path. The client batches uploads in groups of 10 (API Gateway HTTP API has a 10 MB request limit). Groups photos by GPS proximity (10 m threshold). GPS is supplied by the client as a `gpsData` JSON field (parsed defensively — malformed JSON yields a 400); server-side `exifr` extraction is the fallback. `mapLat`/`mapLng` fallbacks use `??` so a genuine `0` coordinate survives.

`PUT /api/photos/:id` updates a photo's `caption`, `direction` (1/2/null), `markerX`/`markerY` (0–1 fractions), and `markerRotation` (0=down, 1=left, 2=right). Called in bulk when the POI edit dialog is saved.

`POST /routes/:id/split` delegates to `db.splitRoute`. `DELETE /route-nodes/:id` returns the full deletion result so the client can do surgical cleanup.

`POST /api/import-gpx` is the GPX import path (counterpart to the client-side GPX/KML export). The browser parses the GPX with `DOMParser` and posts `{ name, color, trackPoints:[{lat,lng}], waypoints:[{lat,lng,name,desc}] }`. The server creates one route from the track and a POI for each text-bearing waypoint (a waypoint with no `name`/`desc` is skipped entirely), linking every POI to a route node at its location. A waypoint within `WAYPOINT_SNAP_M` (8 m) of a track point reuses that node rather than inserting a new one — so round-tripping our own export reconstructs the original POI-linked nodes; otherwise the waypoint node is inserted just after its nearest track point. With no track present, the waypoints themselves form the route in file order. Routes with fewer than 2 nodes aren't created (`route: null` is returned with the POIs). Photos referenced by waypoint `<link>` are not imported.

**`middleware/requireAuth.js`** — guards all write endpoints; reads `req.session.authenticated`.

**`template.yaml`** — AWS SAM template. Defines Lambda function, API Gateway HTTP API, five DynamoDB tables (PAY_PER_REQUEST), and S3 bucket. The bucket has a GET/HEAD `CorsConfiguration` so the offline-cache prefetcher can fetch presigned photo URLs with `mode:'cors'` (non-opaque cached responses; readable 403s for expired presigns). `scripts/deploy.sh` wraps `sam build && sam deploy`.

### Frontend (`public/`)

No build step — plain JS loaded directly by the browser. Scripts served locally (from `node_modules` via `/vendor/` routes) in order: Leaflet → MarkerCluster → exifr lite → `/config.js` → `tile-math.js` → `offline-cache.js` → `app.js`.

**`app.js`** (~2200 lines) organised into sections:

- **Photo scaling / GPS extraction** — `scaleImageFile(file, maxPx=1000)` scales via canvas; `extractGPSFromFiles(files)` reads EXIF from originals before scaling strips it. Both run in parallel in `uploadPhotosToMap`, which batches the scaled files into groups of 10 and posts each batch to `POST /api/upload-photos` with a `gpsData` JSON field. The server prefers `gpsData[i]` over re-extracting from the scaled file.
- **GPX import** — the Edit-mode toolbar `Import GPX` button (mirrored as `mob-import-gpx`, shown/hidden by `setEditMode`) opens a hidden file input. `parseGpx(text)` uses `DOMParser` + `getElementsByTagName` (namespace-agnostic) to pull `<trkpt>` (falling back to `<rtept>`) track points and `<wpt>` waypoints (`name`, `desc`/`cmt`) plus the route name. `importGpxFiles(files)` posts each file to `POST /api/import-gpx`, then adds the returned route (`renderRoute`) and POIs (`addOrUpdateMarker` + `refreshPoiConnectionStyles`) to the live map and fits the view to what was imported. Successive imports cycle `GPX_IMPORT_PALETTE` so routes are visually distinct.
- **Photo URLs** — all photo display uses `ph.url || '/uploads/originals/' + ph.filename` and `ph.thumb_url || '/uploads/thumbs/' + ph.thumb_filename`. On AWS the `url`/`thumb_url` fields are presigned S3 URLs returned by the API; on local they are absent and the fallback paths are used.
- **Tile layers** — `TILE_LAYERS` keyed by display name. Default is `'Topographic'`. All limited-zoom layers use `maxNativeZoom` (not `maxZoom`) so the map zoom is never capped. `handleZoomForLayer` fires on `zoomend`; `aerialFallback` flag is separate from `activeLayerName` so the intended layer is restored on zoom-out. Fallback threshold is `maxNativeZoom + 1`.
- **Map state persistence** — zoom and centre are saved to `localStorage` on every `moveend` and restored before the map is constructed. If no saved position exists and POIs are loaded, the map fits to all POI locations.
- **Marker rendering** — POIs render as circular photo thumbnails (`divIcon`) or blue dots. Markers live in a `L.markerClusterGroup` in view mode and are moved directly onto `map` in edit mode (necessary for drag to work — clustered markers have `_icon = null`). The thumbnail shown is the first photo from `sortedPhotos(poi)`, which puts direction-preferred photos first.
- **Marker drag fix** — `setIcon()` swaps the DOM element but doesn't reset `dragging._enabled`; always call `disable() → setIcon() → enable()` or `addTo(map) → disable() → enable()`.
- **POI labels** — rendered via `marker.bindTooltip(title, { permanent: true, direction: 'auto', className: 'poi-label' })`. Hidden at zoom < `LABEL_MIN_ZOOM` (13); a `zoomend` listener shows/hides all tooltips. Labels use `width: max-content; max-width: 160px` so short titles don't wrap prematurely.
- **POI click routing** (view mode) — `openFullModal` if POI has title or note; `openLightbox(poi, 0)` if photos only; `showPreview` as fallback.
- **Loading indicator** — `#loading-overlay` covers the map until the startup `Promise.all([checkAuth(), loadPois(), loadRoutes()])` resolves, then fades out and is removed from the DOM.
- **Edit mode** — `setEditMode(on)` moves markers between cluster and map, toggles toolbar buttons (Upload Photos, Edit Routes) and the edit-indicator banner. Always starts off on page load. Entering edit mode reveals all POIs regardless of direction filter; exiting re-applies it.
- **Direction preference** — toolbar control (All/1/2) stored in `localStorage`. Buttons show `"To: <name>"` when `currentRoute.dir1_name` / `dir2_name` are set, falling back to `"1"`/`"2"`; `updateDirPrefButtons()` is called from `renderPhoto` so the names refresh whenever a photo is displayed. `sortedPhotos(poi)` sorts matching-direction photos first; `shouldHidePoi(poi)` returns true if all photos have the opposite direction.
- **Photo annotations (lightbox edit mode)** — clicking a thumbnail in the edit dialog calls `openEditLightbox(poiId, idx)`, which adds a crosshair overlay on the photo. Clicking the photo places a directional arrow marker (↓/←/→, controlled by rotation buttons); caption and direction tag are also editable. All changes are buffered in `pendingPhotoEdits` and flushed via `PUT /api/photos/:id` calls when the POI is saved. `stashCurrentLightboxPhotoEdit()` snapshots the current photo's state before navigating or closing. The lightbox does not auto-advance while editing — `openEditLightbox` calls `lightboxViewer.open(photos, idx, false)` to suppress the timer.

#### Photo display factory

`createPhotoDisplay({ imgEl, overlayEl, captionEl, dirLabelEl, prevBtn, nextBtn, pauseBtn, onBeforeNav, onAfterNav })` returns an object encapsulating one photo-display context: image src, marker overlay, caption, direction label, prev/next/pause wiring, and the auto-advance interval. Two instances are created up-front:

- `lightboxViewer` — the full-screen modal lightbox; `onBeforeNav`/`onAfterNav` callbacks stash pending photo edits and refresh the edit panel.
- `trackingViewer` — the half-screen tracking panel; no edit callbacks.

`renderMarker(overlayEl, imgEl, ph)` is the shared marker renderer used by both. It compensates for `object-fit: contain` letterboxing in the tracking panel by computing the actual displayed image rect from `imgEl.naturalWidth/Height` and `imgEl.offsetWidth/Height`. Auto-advance is gated on `trackingMode && photos.length > 1` and an optional `autoAdvance` argument to `open()`.

#### Mobile / responsive UI

At ≤480px the toolbar wraps to two rows (title on its own line, dir-pref + ⋮ menu button on the second). The right-side action buttons collapse into `#mobile-menu`, a kebab dropdown — items proxy clicks to the corresponding desktop buttons (`mob-tracking` → `btn-tracking` etc.) so all state lives in one place. `syncMobileMenu()` mirrors visibility, text and `.active` state from desktop buttons to menu items and is called from each state-changing function (`setEditMode`, `setTrackingMode`, `enterRouteEditMode`, `exitRouteEditMode`, `checkAuth`, `logout`).

`#route-edit-indicator` has its own kebab menu (`#route-edit-menu` with the `mobile-menu-up` variant that opens upward since the indicator sits at the bottom). The native colour picker (`<input type="color">`) is hidden at narrow widths via `opacity: 0; pointer-events: none` while remaining in the DOM; tapping the menu's "Colour" item calls `routeColorInput.click()` to open the OS picker. The swatch is updated from `routeColorInput.value` when the menu opens.

`--toolbar-height` is a CSS variable kept in sync with `#toolbar.offsetHeight` (set by `updateToolbarHeightVar()`, called on resize). The tracking panel positions itself relative to it (`top: var(--toolbar-height)`) so it sits below the actual toolbar height even when the toolbar wraps to two rows on narrow screens.

#### Tracking mode

Auto-enabled on load when `Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight) <= 768` (catches phones in either orientation but not tablets/desktops).

**Layout.** Portrait: panel at `top: var(--toolbar-height); height: 33vh`, map fills the remaining ~67vh below. Landscape: panel takes the left 50%, map the right 50%. The `#crosshair` element is positioned by CSS at the centre of the visible map area (`top: calc(var(--toolbar-height)/2 + 66.5vh)` portrait, `left: 75%` landscape).

**Crosshair pixel — `getCrosshairPixel()`.** Reads the rendered `#crosshair` element's `getBoundingClientRect` rather than recomputing from `sz.y * 0.33`. Important on Android: the dynamic URL bar makes `100vh` (used by CSS) and `window.innerHeight` (used by `map.getSize()`) drift apart by tens of pixels, which would otherwise put the JS detection out of step with the visible crosshair.

**POI matching — `getPoiAtCrosshair()`.** A POI qualifies when *any* of:
1. Its lat/lng is within 40 m (ground distance, via `map.distance`) of the crosshair.
2. The crosshair pixel falls within its marker icon (radius = max(iconSize.x, iconSize.y) / 2).
3. The crosshair pixel falls within the cluster icon currently representing it — `clusterGroup.getVisibleParent(marker)` returns the marker itself when unclustered, or the parent cluster when clustered.

Among qualifying POIs the one with the smallest ground distance wins. The icon-overlap test does *not* gate on `parent._icon` because MarkerCluster's `removeOutsideVisibleBounds` (default `true`) prunes elements at the viewport edge, making `_icon` flicker null even for visible POIs. `iconSize` is normalised through `L.point()` since marker icons store it as `[w, h]` arrays while cluster icons store it as `L.Point` objects.

**Live GPS tracking.** `#btn-live-track` (target icon, `position: fixed; right: 12px; bottom: 25vh`) is shown only in tracking mode + view mode + when `navigator.geolocation` is available (`updateLiveTrackBtn()`). Clicking it calls `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`; each fix calls `panMapToUserLocation(lat, lng)` which `map.panBy`s the offset between the user's pixel and the crosshair pixel. A user-initiated `dragstart` turns it off (programmatic `panBy` does not fire `dragstart`).

**Camera button.** `#btn-camera-photo` (camera icon, sits ~56 px below the live-track button on the right edge) appears only when `trackingMode && authenticated && hasCamera && navigator.geolocation`. `hasCamera` is determined once at startup via `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` (falling back to `'ontouchstart' in window` if the API isn't available). Visibility is refreshed inside `syncMobileMenu()` so it tracks auth + tracking state changes. Clicking opens a hidden `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">` (back camera). On `change`, `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` provides the lat/lng and `uploadPhotosToMap([file], { lat, lng })` posts the photo to the bulk endpoint with the GPS as override; the server then groups it (10 m threshold) into the nearest existing POI or creates a new one.

**`uploadPhotosToMap(files, gpsOverride?)`** has an optional `gpsOverride` parameter. When supplied, every file in the batch is uploaded with that lat/lng instead of EXIF-extracted GPS — used by the camera-button path because freshly-shot Android photos often have their EXIF GPS stripped before the page sees them.

**No-photos POI.** `renderTrackingPanel(poi)` hides `#tracking-photo-wrap` when `lightboxPhotosFor(poi)` is empty so the empty `<img>` doesn't render as a broken-image icon — only title and note are shown.

**Re-detection on retoggle / upload.** `setTrackingMode` resets `trackingPoiId` to `null` whenever it switches state, so toggling tracking off and back on with the crosshair still over the same POI re-renders the panel (otherwise the `if (newId === trackingPoiId) return;` guard in `updateTrackingDisplay` would skip it). After `uploadPhotosToMap` finishes, if the upload touched the currently-tracked POI, `renderTrackingPanel(pois[trackingPoiId])` is called so the slideshow restarts and the new photo enters the rotation.

**Onboarding cue.** On the off→on transition (and only when not in edit mode), `showCrosshairHint()` is scheduled with a 50 ms delay — long enough for layout to settle. It pulses the crosshair red four times via a CSS animation on `#crosshair.flash::before/::after` (~1.6 s total) and pops a `#crosshair-tip` ("move points here to see details") just above the crosshair for ~3.5 s, positioned via `getBoundingClientRect`. The crosshair is hidden whenever edit mode is on; restored on edit-mode exit if tracking is still active.

#### Offline caching (Track mode)

Keeps the map, POIs and photos displaying through mobile signal drop-outs on a walk. **The cache is a pure offline fallback: it's read only when a fetch fails (we've gone offline), never while online, so the service worker doesn't interfere with normal online operation. It's charged with nearby content only while Track mode is on** (by the prefetcher) plus the app shell at SW install — nothing accumulates during ordinary online browsing. Three files, no build step:

- **`tile-math.js`** — pure helpers, UMD-wrapped so the same file loads in the page (`window.TileMath`), the service worker (`importScripts` → `self.TileMath`) and node:test (`require`, see `test/tile-math.test.js`). Slippy-map math (`latLngToTile`, `tilesForRadius` — handles the NLS layer's 512px grid / `zoomOffset:-1`), a `PROVIDERS` table mirroring `TILE_LAYERS` (keep the two in sync), and the cache-key normalisers: `normaliseTileKey` folds `a|b|c` subdomains and strips the MapTiler `?key=` into `/__tile/<provider>/<z>/<x>/<y>`; `normalisePhotoKey` maps local `/uploads/...` paths *and* presigned S3 URLs (signature stripped) onto one `/__photo/(originals|thumbs)/<file>` key — so cached photo bodies never expire with their presigns. Also home to `CACHES`/`CACHE_VERSION`: **bump `CACHE_VERSION` whenever cache key formats or routing change** so stale caches are dropped on SW activate.

- **`sw.js`** — service worker (scope `/`). Precaches the app shell on install (`Promise.allSettled` so one missing asset can't block). **Every route is network-first: the worker returns the network response whenever the fetch resolves and reads the cache only when the fetch *rejects* (offline) — so it never serves stale content online.** Tiles are fetched `mode:'cors'` (non-opaque, accurate quota), photos `cors` then `no-cors`; on failure both fall back to the cached copy under the normalised key. `/api/pois|routes|projects` and `/auth/status` fall back to the cached copy and then to a synthesized empty response — so the startup `Promise.all` never rejects offline and the loading overlay always clears. Other same-origin GETs (app shell) fall back to the precached copy. Non-GET and other `/api/`/`/auth/`/`/uploads/` traffic passes straight through. **The worker never *writes* to the cache** — charging is done by the shell precache (install) and the prefetcher (Track mode); a `{type:'trim'}` message from the prefetcher enforces entry-count caps (tiles 2500 / photos 600 / api 40). `server.js` serves `sw.js` with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so deploys pick up promptly.

- **`offline-cache.js`** — prefetch manager, exposed as `window.OfflineCache = { init, setTracking, noteLayerChange, notePoisChanged }` and wired from app.js (`init` + `setTracking(trackingMode)` after the startup data load — tracking auto-enables *before* POIs exist; `setTrackingMode`, `switchLayer`, `switchProject` call the rest). Registers the SW (gated on `!window.Cypress`; specs also run at desktop viewport so the manager stays idle in e2e). While tracking is on: an initial pass prefetches a **2 km radius** around the current position (GPS, falling back to the crosshair via `getCrosshairPixel`), then a 5-minute review keeps **1 km** topped up; a detected drop-out (5 consecutive network errors end a pass early) switches to 45-second polling and shows the `#offline-status` badge, recovering with a full 2 km pass. Only the **active layer's** tiles are fetched, map zooms 12–16, at the provider's `politeConcurrency` (2 for OSM/OpenTopoMap per their bulk-download policies); photos (originals + thumbs) for POIs within radius; a 403 mid-pass means an expired presign — `refreshPoiPhotoUrls()` (app.js) re-fetches `/pois` and swaps `url`/`thumb_url` in place without rebuilding markers. Each pass also re-puts `/api/pois|routes|projects` + `/config.js` into the caches from the page — necessary because on a first-ever visit the startup fetches race ahead of the SW taking control, and it keeps cached data opportunistically fresh. The page writes into the same Cache Storage caches the SW reads (keys agree via `tile-math.js`), so prefetch works even before the SW controls the page.

Known limits: the aerial deep-zoom fallback layer isn't prefetched (grey offline at z>18); a first-ever load with no signal can't work (no SW yet); SW registration needs a secure context, so phone testing over LAN `http://192.168.x.x:3000` won't register — use `chrome://inspect` port forwarding or the AWS deployment.

#### Bottom indicators

Only one of `#edit-indicator` (orange "Edit Mode" banner) and `#route-edit-indicator` (blue route-editing controls) is visible at a time. Both sit at `bottom: 0`. `enterRouteEditMode` hides the edit-indicator; `exitRouteEditMode` restores it (when `editMode` is still true). The Edit-Mode banner has an "Edit Routes" shortcut button on the right that proxies clicks to `btn-enter-route-edit`.

#### Map click suppression after colour picker

On mobile, dismissing the native colour picker by tapping outside it lets the tap fall through to the Leaflet map. `routeColorInput.addEventListener('click', ...)` arms a `suppressNextMapClick` flag whenever the picker is invoked (directly or via `routeColorInput.click()` from the menu); the next `map.on('click')` event consumes the flag and returns early. The flag is cleared by the input's `input` event so a real colour selection doesn't leave it stale.

#### Help / welcome modal

`HELP_CONTENT.welcome()` and `HELP_CONTENT.edit()` return HTML strings; the welcome variant branches on `trackingMode` (rather than screen size) to pick the mobile-flavoured guide vs the desktop one — so the visible state of the Track button stays in sync with what the help describes. `showHelp(key)` populates `#help-overlay`, `maybeShowHelp(key)` only triggers when the matching `localStorage.helpSeen_<key>` flag is unset (and sets it). Welcome auto-opens once after the loading overlay clears; edit auto-opens once on the first call to `setEditMode(true)`. The toolbar `?` button (mirrored as a "Help" item in `#mobile-menu`) always shows the welcome variant.

#### OAuth → edit-mode handoff

When the user clicks Edit while not authenticated, the login overlay opens *and* `localStorage.editAfterAuth` is set. After an OAuth round-trip lands them back at the app, the post-load handler checks `authenticated && localStorage.editAfterAuth` and, if both, calls `setEditMode(true)` and clears the flag. The flag is also cleared on cancel / outside-click of the login modal and on a successful password login (which already enters edit mode directly), so a later OAuth login from the welcome screen alone doesn't unexpectedly switch to edit mode.

#### URL-bar collapsing on mobile

PWA-ish meta tags (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `mobile-web-app-capable`, `theme-color`, `viewport-fit=cover`) make "Add to Home Screen" launch in standalone mode. As a best-effort fallback while in-browser, the init block does a one-pixel `window.scrollTo(0, 1)` after temporarily setting `documentElement.style.minHeight = 'calc(100% + 1px)'`; this nudges some Android Chrome versions into auto-collapsing the URL bar. iOS Safari and current Chrome still require user-initiated scrolling, but the trick is harmless when ineffective.

#### Route editing

State variables: `routeEditMode`, `waitingForRouteStart`, `activeRouteId`, `extendingFromStart`, `selectedNodeId`, `undoStack`.

**Entry flow** (`waitingForRouteStart = true`):
- Click a start/end node → activates that route for extension, selects the node (falls through — no early return)
- Click a POI with exactly one linked endpoint → extends that route
- Click map → `createNewRouteAndActivate()` creates a new route
- Click a polyline segment → inserts node into that route (also activates it)

**Polyline click / segment insert** — `poly.on('click')` calls both `L.DomEvent.stopPropagation(e)` AND `e.originalEvent.stopPropagation()` to prevent the map's click handler from also firing (Leaflet's `stopPropagation` on a layer event only sets an internal flag, not the native DOM event). Uses `findClosestSegmentIndex` (perpendicular pixel distance) to identify the segment, then calls `POST /routes/:id/nodes` with `afterNodeId`.

**Node icons** — POI-linked nodes render as 0×0 (hidden behind the POI marker) unless selected. Unlinked nodes are also 0×0 outside route-edit mode. `ZERO_ICON` is a shared `L.divIcon` with `iconSize: [0,0]`.

**Selection** — `selectNode` / `deselectNode` enable/disable Delete Node, Split Route, Delete Route buttons and the colour picker. The colour picker reflects the selected node's route and persists on `change`.

**Keyboard shortcuts** (route-edit mode only, ignored in inputs): `Delete` → delete selected node; `Ctrl+Z` → undo last added node.

**Split route** — `splitSelectedRoute()` calls `POST /routes/:id/split`; cleans up stale markers for moved tail nodes before calling `renderRoute` on the new route.

**Cascade on POI delete** — `deleteCurrentPoi()` calls `DELETE /pois/:id` which returns `{deletedNodeIds, deletedRouteIds}`; client does surgical cleanup of markers, polylines and route state before removing the POI marker.

**Auto-cleanup on exit** — `exitRouteEditMode` checks `undoStack[top]`: if the most recently added node is the only node in its route (the user started a route but didn't finish it), it fires `deleteNode(lastNodeId)` which cascades the empty route. The deletion runs after the synchronous UI cleanup so the user perceives the exit immediately.

### Data model

```
pois         (id, lat, lng, title, note, project_id, created_at, updated_at)
  └── photos (id, poi_id, filename, thumb_filename, original_name, order_index, project_id, created_at,
              caption, direction, marker_x, marker_y, marker_rotation)

routes       (id, name, color, project_id, created_at)
  └── route_nodes (id, route_id, order_index REAL, lat, lng, poi_id → pois.id, project_id)
```

- `project_id` on `photos`/`route_nodes` mirrors the parent POI/route's project, set at insert time (SQLite via an `INSERT … SELECT` subquery; DynamoDB copied from a sibling node or fetched from the parent). It lets a project's children be fetched without joining every project's rows in memory. **SQLite** filters children by `project_id` directly (a startup migration backfills existing rows from their parents). **DynamoDB** has no backfill, so `getAllPois`/`getAllRoutes` scope children by parent-membership (the set of the project's POI/route ids) rather than the child's own `project_id`, keeping legacy rows correct; the stored `project_id` is there for a future `project_id` GSI to replace the full-table scans.

- `photos.direction` — integer 1 or 2 (or null); used for direction-preference filtering/sorting.
- `photos.marker_x`, `photos.marker_y` — 0–1 fractions of image dimensions; position of the arrow marker tip.
- `photos.marker_rotation` — integer 0=down, 1=left, 2=right; selects which of three arrow polygon shapes to render.

- `id` fields are auto-increment integers in SQLite; UUID strings in DynamoDB.
- `route_nodes.order_index` is a float so `insertRouteNode` can bisect without renumbering.
- **SQLite**: deleting a route cascades its nodes; deleting a POI sets `route_nodes.poi_id = NULL` via FK. `deletePoiLinkedNodes` then removes orphaned nodes and cleans up sub-2-node routes.
- **DynamoDB**: no FK cascades — all cascade logic is implemented explicitly in `db-dynamo.js`. `poi_id` is omitted from route node items (not stored as NULL) when unset; DynamoDB GSI key attributes cannot hold NULL values.
- Photo files: `uploads/originals/{uuid}.{ext}` and `uploads/thumbs/{uuid}_thumb.jpg` (local), or `originals/{uuid}.{ext}` and `thumbs/{uuid}_thumb.jpg` (S3 keys).
